While learning a new skill such as a language, an instrument or a dance-move the often advised solution for all the shortcomings is ‘practice’. Since the early ages, ‘practice’ has been the most potent way of perfecting any technique or skill. But, really how important the term ‘practice’ is in one’s life? What does practice do to one’s skills?

Practice creates lasting memory
Human memory can be divided into two groups, flitting memories and lasting memories. When you are trying to gather knowledge or master a skill, the goal is to create a lasting memory that stays with you for a longer period of time. Now, lasting memory can only be created by regular repetition, in other words, practice. The longer the practice period the more lasting the memory will be. Thus, if you want to retain the skill or knowledge for life, lifelong practice is necessary.

Practice creates automaticity
Actions of any human being are defined by working memory or thoughts. But, as working memory has a very limited space, some functions have to be automated for the person to function properly. Cognitive processes such as writing with correct grammar, speaking in any language, identifying a colour etc are essentially automated processes that have achieved automaticity through repeated occurrence, in other words through practice. This automaticity of basic processes lets the mind horn difficult aspects such as problem solving, creativity etc. For example, once writing with correct grammar is an automated process, one can focus on expressing the feeling and emotions through written words. With practice, one can make most skills rather automated processes and strive for greater knowledge.

Practice creates excellence
Be it any skill or knowledge, repeated practice creates excellence. When you practice one skill or trade repeatedly, you know the patterns and problems that may arises and also know how to solve those problems, thus show excellence in the trade or field of knowledge.

Practice enhances motivation
Repeating any exercise over time enables you to excel in the skill. Practicing any skill or exercise for a period of time gives you the motivation to become better than the best.

Practice increases self-reliance
Repeated practice creates excellence and excellence give confidence and self reliance. As you keep practicing your trade or any skill, you start to interpret the patters and issues. At the same time, you also use critical thinking to solve those issues. Practicing this over time gives you ample dose of confidence to solve any problem.
