I recall that childhood memory “learning is never ending process” 

Being a technology geek I was always attracted towards developing applications. And that led me to complete my Masters in IT from BITS Pilani in 2012. After college, I worked with ATC Infotech for 2 years where I was lucky to work on some of interesting assignments such as developing a program for a logistics company, application for education sector companies, leads aggregator platform for a B2B entity in Hospitality, etc. 

My second job was with HCL where I moved, honestly speaking, to find a project in US and fly to the land of dreams. And, you call it my good luck or calculated move, I was immediately assigned to a team working on developing trading platform for a hedge fund in US. Despite being good at IT, I struggled at that assignment due to my limited understanding of Finance functions and related terminologies. And then came the moment life that gave a new direction to my future both professionally and personally. My boss on that assignment, being one of the best managers I have known ever, asked me to learn CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) under HCL’s education sponsorship program.

I was both surprised and confused. Surprised because I wasn’t expecting it and confused because I never saw myself as a finance guy and was not sure if this was a right decision for me. But my manager, who also happened to be a CFA and IT engineer himself, convinced me to take that opportunity up. He told me in as many words “You are going to do CFA whether you like it or not”. With scepticism in mind and self-doubt over my capability to understand the world of Finance, I said yes. Being a non-finance guy I know nothing about it. But fortunately, in December 2015 I cleared my CFA level1 examination. 

How did that happen? 

Lot of Hardwork, Guidance (from my boss) and Practice.  And yes some luck too!

Hardwork has never been an issue with me. I could study hard and learn anything. But the most challenging part is to be able to retain that knowledge and more so if you are new to that domain. I was new to Finance and to all those concepts, theories and terminologies. But I practised and practiced hard. I like to mention here about <a href="http://prepsmarter.com/">prepsmarter.com</a> that helped me great deal with my practice. It’s an online tool for daily self-learning which is very simple to use and is completely adaptive. And the quality & difficulty of question was as good as Schweser notes. And guess what?… it was free too! When I started with Prepsmarter I had a proficiency level of 25%-35% in most of the 10 topics and by the end of my practice term of 3.5 months I ended up with proficiency level of 80%+ in all subjects. 

Anyhow, now I am preparing for Level II along with my job. I must admit that I feel much confident now being a part of handful of people who possess unique combination of IT and Finance skills. This experience has made me realise how important it is to keep learning something new and never ever compromise on practice. 

On job front, the development of that application is in final stages and I am in US for last 2 months. Once CFA is cleared I am planning to pursue PHD in Computer Science from Pennsylvania. 
Now….would you not call my decision to do CFA a life changing moment?! I hope, this blog helps to change someone else’s life too.

Never Stop Learning! And Practice Hard!
