Adaptive learning is a relatively new approach to education. It is, in fact, a computer-based method to enhance a student’s learning experience. As students, you may gain a better comprehension, understanding, and retention. For example, an online program used for adaptive learning may not only find a mistake in an essay that you submit, but it may also offer corrections and extra material to help you. Indeed, adaptive learning is an innovating teaching and learning strategy. This method of learning is largely based on content. Instructional content is devised in such a way that it suits your individual needs that may be very different from your friends’ requirements. You can reap several benefits out of an adaptive learning platform.

Customized
As mentioned above, an adaptive learning platform is personalized. It can assess your current level of knowledge and determine what areas you need to improve on. This assessment is done through activities and questions. Your weaknesses, as well as your strengths in particular areas are determined, such that you know where to focus your attention. In short, you will feel that you have an online tutor that also acts as a study guide.

Accessibility
One of the best ways in which adaptive learning platforms can help you learn faster is by being highly accessible. In fact, most of these platforms are available 24/7 from any device that is web-enabled. This means that you can access your notes and lessons and review these any time convenient to you and also, from any location. You have total control over your learning schedule such that no time is wasted.

Efficiency
It is often said that one should work smarter, not harder. The same goes for learning. When you spend much time on a topic that has been covered before, it does not mean you are actually learning more efficiently. It would be better to focus on topics that you are yet to learn. Adaptive learning helps you skip over material that you have already mastered and guides you to focus on the coursework that you should pay particular attention to.

Adaptability 

Adaptive learning has the ability to change the instruction immediately as a student’s knowledge level is assessed. The technology can pick up the areas where you perform well and those where you struggle. It will adapt the instructions in real-time. Thus, there is optimization of learning since the program can modify its approach to suit your individual level. This will ensure that you master the material before you move on to a more difficult level.

Engagement
What better way to learn than to be fully engaged in the process? Most students nowadays are tech savvy. You prefer dealing with e-books than paperbacks. You prefer online video games than street games. Similarly, adaptive learning makes use of technology. This will sustain your interest and engagement level more. You will find yourself spending more time studying than you would with books and pens on your desk.

Own Pace
You no longer have to feel overwhelmed by fast paced colleagues finishing all their work before you. In classes especially, many students feel stuck because of this issue. With adaptive learning, the online program sets the pace for you. It sets the right pace according to your skill level, knowledge level and response level. You are, hence, able to work at your own pace and be the best version of yourself without being pressurized.
