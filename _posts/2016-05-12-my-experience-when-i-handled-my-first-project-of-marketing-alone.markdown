3 Years back i was in India. Now i am in California. I came to california for job. I completed my MBA in fiance from XLRI , India. I got campus placement. Only in 8 months i got handsome hike in my package and also i got promoted.

We all know when we get promotion, our responsibilites get increased. Being a finance fresher and i studied in India. So it was little painful to work in California. I had to increase my knowledge. As finance laws are different from India. I took help of <a href="https://prepsmarter.com/">PrepSmarter</a> and i increased my knowledge. You know what was the result of this. I was handled a project of finance marketing. I had to handle this project as project mangaer with my team. 

It is like dream come true to me. Yes the project is still going on. I am performaing very well not as bos but as a leader. I learned that when the opportunity knock , you shoudl welcome it with open arms. No matter what you have to do to grab that opportunity . Grab it.
